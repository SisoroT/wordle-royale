# Wordle Royale

**World Royale** is a spin on the popular web-based word game [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle). Traditional Wordle gives players **six chances** to guess a **five letter word**. After each guess, players are **given information via the color of the tile** around each letter.<br>

The tile colors and their meanings are as follows:

Green - Letter is **in the correct answer** and **in that position**<br>
Yellow - Letter is **in the correct answer** but **not that position**<br>
Gray - Letter is **not in the correct answer** at all

### What's Different?

**Wordle Royale** follows the same premise of the original Wordle but with a twist. **Each guess** will either **reward or punish** the player by either **adding or removing the remaining guesses**. In addition, **word length is six letters** instead of five and the **starting number of guesses is three** instead of six.

# Different Situations

Due to the addition of rewards and punishments, there are an abundance of different situations a player can run into while playing Wordle Royale.<br>

_Here are the situations players may find themselves in:_

## All Gray Squares

Any guess with **all gray squares** will result in **losing one of the remaining guesses**.

## First Yellow Square

The **first guess** with a **at least one yellow** square will result in gaining **one extra guess**.

## First Green Square

The **first guess** with a **at least one green** square will result in gaining **two extra guesses**. Note that in this example the player has **two green squares on this guess but still only receives the reward for one green square**.<br>

_In the situation a reward has not yet been dealt and the players guess includes multiple of the same color square, the player will receive the reward of just one of the squares._

## First Green and Yellow Squares

If a player has **not yet used their first yellow or green** square, **both rewards will be dealt** resulting in a gain of **three extra guesses**.
